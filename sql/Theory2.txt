TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

UNION::
it is used to combine the result set of two or more SELECT statements.

To use it:
every SELECT should have same no of columns
columns must have similar data types.
columns in every SELECT should be in same order.

SELECT COLUMN(s) FROM tableA
UNION
SELECT COLUMN(s) FROM tableB;
//UNION returns all the unique records present in two tables where as UNION ALL returns all the records even the duplicate ones.

A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

A view always shows up-to-date data.

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT rollno, name FROM student;//mane rolllno and name column nie ekta virtual table create korbe named view_name

SELECT * FROM view_name;
